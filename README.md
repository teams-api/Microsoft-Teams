### Create and Manage Your Team

In Microsoft Teams, a "team" serves as a centralized digital workspace for your class, department, or project group. Properly setting up the team ensures smooth and efficient collaboration throughout its lifespan.

**To request a new team** (usually initiated by administrators):

* Provide the team name
* Write a brief description
* Designate an owner or administrator

After the team is created:

**Add Members:**

1. Navigate to the team and click "More options."
2. Select "Manage Team."
3. Click “Add Member,” search for users by name or email, and then select “Done.”

You can assign roles such as **Owner**, **Member**, or **Guest** to manage access and permissions effectively.

## Organize Content with Channels and Tabs

Microsoft Teams organizes discussions and resources through **Channels**, while **Tabs** allow you to centralize frequently used tools and content.

**Channels:**

Every team automatically includes a default “General” channel. You can create additional channels to concentrate on specific topics, units, or collaborative projects.

To add a new channel:

1. Click “More options” next to the team name.
2. Select “Add channel.”
3. Enter the name, choose its privacy setting (Standard or Private), and provide a brief description.
4. Click “Add.”

**Tabs:**

Tabs, positioned at the top of each channel, offer quick access to important tools:

* **Posts** – Organized threads for discussions
* **Files** – Shared documents and folders
* **Class Notebook** – A collaborative OneNote notebook
* **Custom Tabs** – Integrate apps like Forms, Planner, or third-party tools

This setup minimizes distractions and ensures that essential resources are easily accessible.

## Communicate Effectively with Students

Effective communication is key in any virtual learning environment, and Microsoft Teams provides several tools to keep you connected.

**Conversations and Posts:**

* Use channels to send messages that are visible to the entire class.
* Mention specific users or groups using “@mentions.”
* Encourage engagement with reactions such as emojis, likes, or GIFs.

**Private Chats:**

* Start individual or group chats.
* Perfect for virtual office hours or personal check-ins.
* Share messages, files, or initiate calls directly from the chat window.

**Engagement Tools:**

Enhance the personality and warmth of your virtual teaching:

* Quickly react with **Emojis**
* Share **GIFs** and **custom memes** via the Stickers feature
* Share links and documents that are searchable and archived

## Schedule and Host Virtual Meetings

Scheduling and hosting virtual classes, meetings, or discussions is simple with Microsoft Teams.

**Methods for scheduling a meeting:**

* Go to the **Calendar** tab and click **+ New Meeting**
* In a **channel**, use **Schedule a meeting** below the message field
* Within a **chat**, click the calendar icon to schedule a meeting with participants

Fill out the following:

* Meeting title
* Date and time
* Select a channel or input participant emails
* Set the recurrence (daily, weekly, etc.)

**To invite external guests**, enter their full email address—they will receive a link to join via email.

**Before entering a meeting:**

* Ensure your camera and microphone settings are correct
* Enable or disable video/audio as required

**To join a meeting:**

Guests can join via a web browser, though signed-in users will have access to the full range of features.

## Collaborate on Files and Assignments

Microsoft Teams isn't just a communication tool—it also provides comprehensive features for collaboration and learning.

**Sharing Files:**

* Upload files from OneDrive, your computer, or another channel
* All shared files are saved in the **Files** tab for easy access
* Work together on Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files directly within Teams

**Collaboration Tools:**

* Utilize the **OneNote Class Notebook** for journaling, brainstorming, or shared notes
* Add **Planner** tabs for task management or **Forms** for quizzes and surveys

**Simultaneous editing** allows students to collaborate in real time—ideal for group projects.

## Track Student Progress and Use Class Notebook

**Assignments and Grades:**

Microsoft Teams includes a robust assignment system designed for educators:

* Create, distribute, and collect assignments
* Add grading rubrics and category tags
* Provide feedback and monitor student submissions
* Grades are stored in the **Grades tab**

Assignments can be scheduled in advance, reused across different classes, and filtered by student for detailed insights.

**Class Notebook:**

Each team has an integrated **Class Notebook**, consisting of:

* **Collaboration Space** – A shared workspace for group projects
* **Content Library** – A read-only area for essential resources and materials
* **Private Notebooks** – Individual sections for each student
